- Warner Bros. releases the most movies over the years but ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> in terms of total grossings.
- Disney accumulates the highest grossing and releases 588 movies in total (236 less compared to Warner Bros.)
- Among the top 10 distributors, only Dreamworks releases under 100 movies in total, but still manage to surpass Miramax (385 movies) in Total Grossings. 
- Insight: Number of movies released doesn't exactly affect the total grossings, this could be due to audience preference of quality over quantity.
